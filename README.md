## Rushes

The rushes are the ideal way to explore problems that are complementary
to the regular projects of the curriculum, in immersion with your colleagues.
For example, on a weekend, there's going to be a specific topic a to
concentrate, cross new heads for the future projects, and adopt an intensive
rhythm!
